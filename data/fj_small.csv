Technology can be expensive, both in terms of hard costs and costly mistakes, so we’re as careful with your money as we are with our own.   Perhaps that’s why some of our clients have been with us for over 10 years. When faced with a new problem our first instinct is always to see if someone else has already solved it. As such, the solutions we design are built on the rich eco-system of open source software (OSS); the proven and battle-tested kind that we know will not just do the job quickly and cost-effectively, but also robustly. Where OSS isn't appropriate we always favour solutions that are built to open standards that we know will integrate well with other technologies.Strong partnerships.Our work is complemented by strong partnerships with technology vendors and suppliers.   Proven over time, our established strategic relationships with many of the leaders in software, hardware and other technology solutions help ensure we’re able to continue to offer best-in-class technical solutions for our clients.What we do:High availability and high performance website architecture &amp; developmentWeb content management solutionsCreative technology ideationContent optimisation, search and analyticsHigh volume, multi-locale email campaignsMobile optimisationLocalisation","At VML, testing is an integral part of our software development process.

Back in those days we were one of the first few purely digital marketing agencies in London; and back then things were a lot more technically driven than they often are today; as such the Technology team here continues to enjoy a strong strategic influence on the work that the agency undertakes and the clients that we engage.It just works.Technology is brilliant when you don’t have to think about it. That’s what we strive for in our solutions. Our technology team has a strong strategic influence on the work we undertake and are involved as soon as the brief lands. They stay involved throughout strategy, creative concepting and design. Acting as important enablers, we bring new and emerging technology to the table to successfully marry the requirements of our clients with the vision of our creatives.Open standards, open minds.We aim to deliver the most elegant technical solution for your budget, and maintain a technology agnostic approach to development in order to achieve that. Technology can be expensive, both in terms of hard costs and costly mistakes, so we’re as careful with your money as we are with our own.   Perhaps that’s why some of our clients have been with us for over 10 years. When faced with a new problem our first instinct is always to see if someone else has already solved it. As such, the solutions we design are built on the rich eco-system of open source software (OSS); the proven and battle-tested kind that we know will not just do the job quickly and cost-effectively, but also robustly.

Our mission is to give people the tools to turn whatever they want into newsprint, quickly and easily.The company was founded in 2009 by Ben Terrett, Tom Taylor and Russell Davies, who felt that rumours of print’s death had been greatly exaggerated. And with more reading being done digitally, the joy of holding something physical was more important than ever. As an experiment, they designed a newspaper called Things Our Friends Have Written On The Internet. It delighted people so much that the seeds of Newspaper Club were born.With initial support from Channel 4’s innovation fund 4iP, the team worked on making the process of designing and printing a newspaper easier. The first step, producing a good-looking newspaper without expensive, complicated design software, was solved by the invention of ARTHR – Newspaper Club’s free layout tool. The next step, finding someone to print it on real newsprint, and understanding what on earth they’re talking about was addressed by partnering with established newspaper printers and building an easy-to-use web service, staffed by a team of friendly people.Since then, we've won a Design of the Year award for Graphics in 2010 and a BIMA for Technical Achievement, and we’ve grown to a team of 13, with offices in London, Birmingham and Glasgow.We’ve printed over 6 million newspapers for thousands of customers all over the world, including the BBC, Coca Cola, the Guardian, Penguin Books, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and Sony Records.And yes, we're still excited about printing newspapers.","Newspaper Club helps people make and print their own newspapers.
