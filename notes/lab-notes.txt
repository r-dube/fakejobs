1. Attempting to use the count vectorizer with Google colab (free version) crashed the colab instance. Colab reports that the crash was due to all available RAM being used up. 
2. Create a medium (20%) version of the data in an attempt to continue using the existing free setup on Colab.

1. A neural network model that uses a basic count vectorizer and an FCNN with fj_small.csv also returns poor results
   Accuracy score: 0.9444444444444444 F1 score: 0.0
2. It is unclear if the poor results are due to the smallness of the dataset, the vectorizer (and parameters passed to it), the lack of other text processing (lemmzatization, stemming) or something else

1. Very basic logistic regression model that does not use an natural language processing returns poor results on the full data set
   Accuracy score: 0.9478 F1 score: 0.0541
