1. A neural network model that uses a basic count vectorizer and an FCNN with fj_small.csv also returns poor results
   Accuracy score: 0.9444444444444444 F1 score: 0.0
2. It is unclear if the poor results are due to the smallness of the dataset, the vectorizer (and parameters passed to it), the lack of other text processing (lemmzatization, stemming) or something else
